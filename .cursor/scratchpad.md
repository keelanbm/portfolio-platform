# PortfolioHub Visual Improvements

## Background and Motivation
The user has reported several visual issues with the current PortfolioHub website:
1. Text readability problems - some text is difficult to read against the background
2. Button border visibility issues - button borders are hard to see
3. Footer centering problems - footer appears off center
4. Body centering issues - overall body content seems off center

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Issues Identified:
1. **Text Contrast Issues:**
   - Using `text-muted-foreground` in footer which may not have enough contrast
   - Some secondary text colors may be too light against dark backgrounds
   - Button text and border colors need better contrast

2. **Button Border Problems:**
   - Secondary buttons use `border-border-secondary` which is very subtle (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12))
   - Button borders may be invisible against certain backgrounds

3. **Layout Centering Issues:**
   - Footer uses `container` class but may not be properly centered
   - Body content may need better container constraints
   - Grid layouts may not be properly centered
