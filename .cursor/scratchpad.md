   - `id`, `title`, `content`, `userId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
   - `status` (open, closed, duplicate)
   - `viewCount`, `answerCount`
   - `tags` (JSON array for tool tags)

2. **`Answer`** - Answer entity linked to questions
   - `id`, `content`, `questionId`, `userId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
   - `isAccepted` (boolean for accepted answer)
   - `voteCount`

3. **`Vote`** - Unified voting system for questions and answers
   - `id`, `userId`, `targetType` (question/answer), `targetId`, `voteType` (upvote/downvote)
   - `createdAt`

4. **`QuestionTag`** - Many-to-many relationship for tool tagging
   - `id`, `questionId`, `tagId`
   - Links to existing `Tag` table

**Schema Relationships:**
- `User` → `Question` (one-to-many)
- `User` → `Answer` (one-to-many)
- `Question` → `Answer` (one-to-many)
- `Question` → `QuestionTag` → `Tag` (many-to-many)
- `User` → `Vote` (one-to-many)

## Lessons

### **Technical Lessons:**
- Supabase pooler connection works better than direct for Prisma
- Environment variables need proper loading for Prisma CLI
- Connection pooling errors can be resolved with proper restart
- Sample data is crucial for testing and development
- 🚨 **NEW:** Complex Prisma retry wrappers cause initialization issues
- 🚨 **NEW:** Next.js environment loading differs from Node.js scripts
- 🚨 **NEW:** Clerk middleware needs proper error handling

## **PLANNER SOLUTION STRATEGY**

### **Issue 1: Database Connection Inconsistency**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Node.js script uses `.env` file directly
- Next.js runtime uses `.env.local` with different precedence
- Environment variable loading order: `.env.local` > `.env`

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Standardize on Direct Connection (Recommended)**
```bash
# Use direct connection in both .env and .env.local
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:L9sPBW3WraFicBUKeWCc@db.epfgirkjjycugnpsvoag.supabase.co:5432/postgres
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:L9sPBW3WraFicBUKeWCc@db.epfgirkjjycugnpsvoag.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Option B: Use Pooler Connection**
```bash
# Use pooler in both files
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.epfgirkjjycugnpsvoag:L9sPBW3WraFicBUKeWCc@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:L9sPBW3WraFicBUKeWCc@db.epfgirkjjycugnpsvoag.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
```bash
# Use pooler for DATABASE_URL, direct for DIRECT_URL
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.epfgirkjjycugnpsvoag:L9sPBW3WraFicBUKeWCc@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres
DIRECT_URL=postgresql://postgres:L9sPBW3WraFicBUKeWCc@db.epfgirkjjycugnpsvoag.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### **Issue 2: Prisma Client Initialization Problems**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Custom retry wrapper interferes with Prisma client initialization
- Turbopack compilation issues with complex wrapper functions
- Retry mechanism should be simpler or removed entirely

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Remove Custom Retry Wrapper (Recommended)**
```typescript
// Simplify to standard Prisma client
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'

const globalForPrisma = globalThis as unknown as {
  prisma: PrismaClient | undefined
}

export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({
  log: ['error', 'warn'],
})

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') globalForPrisma.prisma = prisma
```

**Option B: Use Prisma's Built-in Retry**
```typescript
export const prisma = globalForPrisma.prisma ?? new PrismaClient({
  log: ['error', 'warn'],
  datasources: {
    db: {
      url: process.env.DATABASE_URL,
    },
  },
  // Use Prisma's built-in retry
  errorFormat: 'pretty',
})
```

**Option C: Simple Retry at API Level**
```typescript
// Add retry logic in individual API routes instead of wrapper
const withRetry = async <T>(fn: () => Promise<T>, maxRetries = 3): Promise<T> => {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn()
    } catch (error: any) {
      if (i === maxRetries - 1) throw error
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * Math.pow(2, i)))
    }
  }
  throw new Error('Max retries exceeded')
}
```

### **Issue 3: Middleware Authentication Errors**

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `isProtectedRoute` function causing unhandled rejections
- Clerk middleware configuration issues
- Missing error handling in middleware

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Fix Middleware Configuration (Recommended)**
```typescript
// src/middleware.ts
import { clerkMiddleware, createRouteMatcher } from '@clerk/nextjs/server'

const isProtectedRoute = createRouteMatcher([
  '/dashboard(.*)',
  '/create(.*)',
  '/settings(.*)',
  '/api/projects(.*)',
  '/api/likes(.*)',
  '/api/follows(.*)',
])

export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
  if (isProtectedRoute(req)) {
    return auth.protect()
  }
})

export const config = {
  matcher: ['/((?!.+\\.[\\w]+$|_next).*)', '/', '/(api|trpc)(.*)'],
}
```

**Option B: Simplify Middleware**
```typescript
// Remove complex route matching, protect all API routes
export default clerkMiddleware((auth, req) => {
  if (req.url.includes('/api/') && !req.url.includes('/api/auth/')) {
    return auth.protect()
  }
})
```

### **Supabase Configuration Recommendations**

**Connection Pool Settings:**
1. **Check Supabase Dashboard** - Verify connection pool is enabled
2. **Pool Size** - Default should be sufficient for development
3. **Connection Limits** - Ensure not hitting connection limits
4. **Database Status** - Verify database is active and accessible

**Environment Variable Strategy:**
1. **Use .env.local for development** - Next.js loads this first
2. **Keep .env for production** - Fallback configuration
3. **Verify loading order** - Test with console.log in API routes
4. **Use direct connection initially** - Simpler, more reliable

### **Recommended Implementation Order**

**Step 1: Simplify Prisma Configuration (30 minutes)**
- Remove custom retry wrapper
- Use standard Prisma client
- Test basic connection

**Step 2: Fix Environment Variables (15 minutes)**
- Standardize DATABASE_URL in both .env files
- Use direct connection initially
- Test with API routes

**Step 3: Fix Middleware (15 minutes)**
- Simplify middleware configuration
- Add proper error handling
- Test authentication flow

**Step 4: Comprehensive Testing (30 minutes)**
- Test all API routes
- Test authentication flows
- Verify database operations

**Step 5: Performance Optimization (30 minutes)**
- Add connection pooling if needed
- Monitor performance
- Optimize queries if necessary

### **Development Lessons:**
- Foundation-first approach allows for easier pivots
- Modular architecture supports feature additions
- Visual improvements should be completed before major feature additions
- Database schema should be designed for extensibility

### **Strategic Lessons:**
- Pivot opportunities require quick but stable foundation
- Plugin strategy creates significant competitive moat
- Q&A focus differentiates from pure portfolio platforms
- Monetization should be built into core features, not afterthought

## Plugin & Extension Integration Strategy

### **Core Concept: "Share As You Work" Extensions**
Allow designers and developers to share their work directly from their tools without context switching, with automatic version tracking and tool detection.

**Target Integrations:**
- **Browser Extension** (Chrome/Firefox) for screen captures from any web-based tool
- **Figma Plugin** for direct artboard exports and version management
- **VSCode/Cursor Extension** for code screenshots and project sharing
- **Future**: Adobe CC, Sketch, Framer, Linear, Notion integrations

### **New API Endpoints Needed**

```javascript
// Extension & Plugin APIs
POST /api/extensions/quick-upload          // One-click upload from extensions
POST /api/extensions/screenshot           // Process and upload screenshots
GET  /api/extensions/auth-token           // Get user token for extensions

// Version Management  
POST /api/projects/[id]/versions          // Add new version to existing project
GET  /api/projects/[id]/versions          // Get version history
PUT  /api/projects/[id]/versions/[version] // Update version details
DELETE /api/projects/[id]/versions/[version] // Delete specific version

// Tool Integrations
POST /api/integrations/connect            // Connect new tool integration
GET  /api/integrations                    // List user's connected tools
DELETE /api/integrations/[tool]           // Disconnect tool
POST /api/integrations/[tool]/sync        // Manual sync from tool

// Quick Upload Processing
GET  /api/quick-uploads                   // Get pending uploads for user
POST /api/quick-uploads/[id]/process      // Convert quick upload to project
DELETE /api/quick-uploads/[id]            // Discard quick upload
```

class PortfolioHubExtension {
  constructor(platform) {
    this.platform = platform; // 'chrome', 'figma', 'vscode'
    this.apiClient = new APIClient();
  }
  
  async quickUpload(files, context) {
    // Upload to staging area
    // Auto-detect project match
    // Generate metadata
    // Show user confirmation
  }
  
  async processUpload(uploadId, userInput) {
    // Move from staging to permanent storage
    // Create project or add version
    // Update user dashboard
  }
}
```

#### **Authentication Flow:**
1. User installs extension
2. Extension opens auth popup to main platform
3. Platform generates extension-specific API token
4. Token stored securely in extension
5. All uploads authenticated via token

#### **File Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Quick Upload** → Staging area (24h expiration)
2. **Processing** → Optimize, generate thumbnails, extract metadata
3. **User Review** → Confirm project assignment, add notes
4. **Publish** → Move to permanent storage, update feeds
