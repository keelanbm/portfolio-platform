# Design Portfolio Platform - Development Scratchpad

# Background and Motivation

The goal is to create a Web2-first design portfolio platform that functions similar to Dribbble, with optional Web3 features for true ownership and permanence. After Dribbble's shutdown that deleted many designers' portfolios, there's a clear market need for a platform where designers truly own their work. The platform will start as a traditional social media-style portfolio site but offer optional blockchain integration for users who want permanent ownership and IPFS storage.

## Development Constraints & Strategy
- **Solo Developer**: Focus on maintainable, well-documented code with minimal external dependencies
- **Low Budget MVP**: Prioritize free tiers and cost-effective services, defer expensive features
- **Flexible Timeline**: Quality over speed, iterate based on user feedback
- **Risk Tolerant**: Willing to experiment with Web3 features but Web2-first approach
- **Low Stakes**: Can afford to pivot or fail fast, focus on learning and validation

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Balance between Web2 accessibility and Web3 ownership benefits
- Cost management - IPFS pinning and blockchain operations can be expensive at scale
- User onboarding - need to serve both crypto-native and traditional designers
- Storage strategy - hybrid approach with traditional cloud + optional IPFS
- Monetization without alienating free users
- Performance with image-heavy content and social features
- Smart contract security for NFT minting and marketplace features
- Real-time notification system scalability and cost
- Admin moderation tools and content safety
- User privacy and data protection for messaging features

## New Feature Request: Homepage & Navigation Restructuring 🔄
**User Feedback**: Current homepage is not user-friendly for new users. "Get Started" redirects to dashboard instead of being inviting. Need to make homepage content-focused like Dribbble.

**Analysis**: 
- Current homepage shows hero section with carousel but doesn't showcase actual content
- Navigation is cluttered with too many options in dropdown
- Need to differentiate between public content discovery and authenticated user experience
- Should follow Dribbble's pattern: homepage = content feed for everyone

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Homepage Restructure**: Make homepage a public content feed (similar to current discover page)
2. **Navigation Simplification**: Move key nav items to main bar, reduce dropdown clutter
3. **User Experience Flow**: Clear distinction between public browsing and authenticated features
4. **Content Discovery**: Prioritize content over marketing copy for new users

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### **Phase 1: Homepage Redesign**
**Current State**: Marketing-focused homepage with hero section and carousel
**Target State**: Content-focused homepage showing actual projects

**Tasks**:
1. **Remove Marketing Elements**:
   - Remove hero section with "Showcase Your Design Work" text
   - Remove auto-scrolling carousel with sample projects
   - Remove features section at bottom
   - Keep only essential branding (logo, tagline)

2. **Implement Public Content Feed**:
   - Reuse existing discover feed component for homepage
   - Show all public projects (no authentication required)
   - Add search bar prominently at top
   - Include category/tag filtering
   - Add infinite scroll or pagination

3. **Add Call-to-Action for Non-Authenticated Users**:
   - "Get Started" button in header (leads to signup)
   - "Sign in" button for existing users
   - Subtle prompts to create account for full features

#### **Phase 2: Navigation Restructure**
**Current State**: Complex dropdown with many options
**Target State**: Clean main navigation + simplified dropdown

**New Navigation Structure**:
```
Logo | Search Bar | Discover | Feed* | Profile* | Create* | User Avatar
                                                      [Settings, Logout]
* = Authenticated users only
```

**Tasks**:
1. **Main Navigation Bar**:
   - Logo (left)
   - Search bar (center)
   - Discover (always visible)
   - Feed (authenticated only)
   - Profile (authenticated only)
   - Create button (authenticated only)
   - User avatar dropdown (authenticated only)

2. **User Dropdown Simplification**:
   - Remove redundant navigation items
   - Keep only: Settings, Logout
   - Add user info display

3. **Mobile Navigation**:
   - Hamburger menu for mobile
   - Include all main nav items
   - Maintain responsive design

#### **Phase 3: Page Flow Optimization**
**New User Journey**:

2. **Sign Up**: Clear path to join platform
3. **Feed**: Personalized content from followed users
4. **Discover**: Browse all content with filters
5. **Profile**: Manage own content and settings

**Authentication Flow**:
- "Get Started" → Signup page
- After signup → Feed page (not dashboard)
- After login → Feed page (not dashboard)
- Dashboard becomes admin/analytics only

#### **Phase 4: Technical Implementation**
**Files to Modify**:
1. `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete homepage redesign
2. `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Navigation restructure
3. `src/app/feed/page.tsx` - Ensure proper authentication
4. `src/app/discover/page.tsx` - Public access, no auth required

# Lessons Learned (To be updated as development progresses)

## Architecture Lessons
- Hybrid Web2/Web3 approach provides best of both worlds
- Progressive enhancement allows gradual feature adoption
- Separation of concerns between core platform and blockchain features

## Development Lessons
- Start with solid Web2 foundation before adding Web3 complexity
- User experience should never be compromised for technical features
- Cost modeling is critical for sustainable Web3 integrations

## Build & Deployment Lessons (Critical for Production)
- **Next.js 15 Breaking Changes**: Params and searchParams are now Promises and must be awaited
  - All dynamic routes need `params: Promise<{ paramName: string }>` type
  - All page components must be `async` and use `await params`
  - Search pages need `searchParams: Promise<{ q?: string }>` type
  - API routes need `params: Promise<{ paramName: string }>` type
  - Always test builds locally before pushing to production

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Vercel treats warnings as errors in production builds
  - Use `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` for unavoidable any types
  - Fix unused variables by commenting them out or removing them
  - Handle error types properly: `catch (error: any)` with ESLint disable
  - Always run `npm run build` locally before deployment

- **Prisma Query Issues**: Include related data properly in queries
  - When accessing `project.slides`, ensure slides are included in the query
  - Use proper type casting for complex Prisma results
  - Handle nullable fields appropriately in type definitions

- **Component Import Dependencies**: Missing imports cause build failures
  - Always import skeleton components that are referenced in JSX
  - Remove unused imports to avoid linting warnings
  - Check for missing imports when components are not defined errors occur

- **Error Handling Patterns**: Consistent error handling across API routes
  - Use `catch (error: any)` with ESLint disable for Prisma errors
  - Handle specific error codes like 'P2002' (unique constraint) and 'P2025' (not found)
  - Always provide meaningful error messages in API responses

## Business Lessons
- Freemium model works well for creative platforms
- Storage costs must be carefully managed and passed to users appropriately
- Multiple revenue streams provide more stability than single subscription model

## Growth & Scaling Plan (Planner Mode) — Q1–Q2 2025

### Background and Motivation
We’ve reached feature completeness for a solid designer-focused portfolio and discussion product. The next phase emphasizes sustainable growth, community vitality, and operational resilience without overextending scope. We will adopt a “Stack Overflow meets Portfolio” approach: high-signal content, reputation-driven trust, and lightweight social features that compound engagement.

### Key Growth Principles
- Focus on compounding loops: creation → discovery → feedback → reputation → more creation
- Favor low-complexity, high-leverage features that can be A/B tested quickly
- Maintain a professional tone; avoid gimmicky gamification that harms quality

### North-Star Metrics (NSM) and Signals
- **NSM**: Weekly Active Creators (WAC) who publish or meaningfully comment (≥2 comments/week)
- **Secondary**:
  - Content quality: saves per project, like-to-view ratio
  - Engagement depth: comments/user/week, replies per thread
  - Community growth: new creators/week, returning creators/week
  - Retention: D7 and W4 return rates for creators and viewers

### Initiative Areas and Experiments

1) Reputation & Gamified Merit (lightweight, professional)
- Reputation points for: accepted answers on “Creator Questions”, high-quality comments (likes from non-friends), and project saves.
- Badges: First Project, 5 Projects, First Accepted Answer, 10 Helpful Comments, 100 Saves on a project.
- Creator Tiers (Bronze/Silver/Gold): unlock small perks (profile flair, higher discover weighting, early access to features).
- Success criteria: +20% comments/user/week; +15% submitters returning next week.

2) Competitions & Weekly Themes (community events)
- Weekly Theme Prompt (e.g., “Fintech Dashboard Week”) with a curated showcase page and lightweight judge panel (internal curation for now).
- Micro-competitions: community voting window (likes + saves + juror bonus) with anti-brigading safeguards (rate-limited votes, age of account).
- Success criteria: +15% WAC, +10% new creators, +25% saves/project on themed entries.

3) Discovery & Feed Ranking Improvements
- Trending model v1: recency-weighted score using likes, saves, comments, author reputation.
- Topic follow: follow tags (e.g., “mobile”, “branding”) to personalize Discover.
- Smart related content: on project page, show similar by tags/visual categories.
- Success criteria: +15% CTR from feed to project; +10% saves/session.

4) Creation UX and Onboarding
- “Guided First Upload”: micro-wizard to help pick a strong cover, tags, and description.
- Drafts and reminders: save unfinished project, email/notification nudge in 48h.
- First-7-days creator checklist with progress bar; reward with “New Creator” badge.
- Success criteria: +20% conversion from signup → first project within 72h.

5) Collaboration Signals (designer-to-designer)
- “Looking for feedback” toggle on a project; prioritizes surfacing to helpful commenters.
- “Collaboration interest” tag on profile; simple inbound request inbox.
- Success criteria: +10% comment depth on flagged projects; ≥5% creators toggle collab.

6) Distribution & SEO
- Public profile and project SEO polish (metadata, Open Graph, XML sitemaps).
- Email digests: weekly highlights by followed tags and creators.
- Social share cards: clean, branded OG images for projects and winners.
- Success criteria: +20% organic traffic; +8% click-through from email digests.

7) Moderation, Safety, and Trust
- Reputation-gated powers: low-rep accounts rate-limited; higher-rep can flag.
- Simple abuse heuristics: rapid-like/comment detection, duplicate image checks.
- Success criteria: <1% content removals required; <0.2% abuse reports per session.

8) Analytics & Experimentation
- Event schema: publish, like, save, comment, reply, follow, tag-follow, share.
- A/B testing harness (feature flags) for: theme prompts, badge thresholds, feed weighting.
- Success criteria: ability to run 2–3 concurrent experiments with clean readouts.

9) Performance & Reliability (scaling basics)
- Image pipeline verification (sizes, formats, caching); add fallback for 404s (partial done).
- Supabase indexes for hot queries (projects by tag/date/engagement; comments by project).
- Background jobs for counters (denormalized likes/saves/comments to speed reads).
- Success criteria: P50 page ≤ 1.5s, P95 API ≤ 600ms; <1% image load errors.

### High-level Task Breakdown (Prioritized, small verifiable steps)

P0 – Foundation for Growth Experiments (2 weeks)
1. Event tracking schema (client + API): publish, like, save, comment, reply, follow, tag-follow, share
   - Success: events land in analytics store (e.g., Supabase table) with <0.5% loss

- [ ] P4: Guided First Upload + drafts + checklist
- [ ] P5: DB indexes, counters, and image fallback hardening

### Risks and Mitigations
- Low-quality gaming of points: reputation weighting, rate limits, aged accounts, human-reviewed badges at upper tiers.
- Cold-start for competitions: seed with editorial picks and small prizes (credits/badges), leverage email digest and in-product banners.
- Complexity creep: each feature ships behind a flag with precise success criteria; deprecate if no lift.

### Data We Will Watch
- WAC; saves/project; comments/user/week; CTR feed→project; new creators/week; D7/W4 retention; abuse flag rate.

### Next Step (Executor Handoff)
- Start with P0: implement event schema + feature flags + SEO polish. Once instrumentation is live, we can safely AB test P1/P2.
