# Design Portfolio Platform - Development Scratchpad

# Background and Motivation

The goal is to create a Web2-first design portfolio platform that functions similar to Dribbble, with optional Web3 features for true ownership and permanence. After Dribbble's shutdown that deleted many designers' portfolios, there's a clear market need for a platform where designers truly own their work. The platform will start as a traditional social media-style portfolio site but offer optional blockchain integration for users who want permanent ownership and IPFS storage.

## Development Constraints & Strategy
- **Solo Developer**: Focus on maintainable, well-documented code with minimal external dependencies
- **Low Budget MVP**: Prioritize free tiers and cost-effective services, defer expensive features
- **Flexible Timeline**: Quality over speed, iterate based on user feedback
- **Risk Tolerant**: Willing to experiment with Web3 features but Web2-first approach
- **Low Stakes**: Can afford to pivot or fail fast, focus on learning and validation

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Balance between Web2 accessibility and Web3 ownership benefits
- Cost management - IPFS pinning and blockchain operations can be expensive at scale
- User onboarding - need to serve both crypto-native and traditional designers
- Storage strategy - hybrid approach with traditional cloud + optional IPFS
- Monetization without alienating free users
- Performance with image-heavy content and social features
- Smart contract security for NFT minting and marketplace features
- Real-time notification system scalability and cost
- Admin moderation tools and content safety
- User privacy and data protection for messaging features

## New Feature Request: Homepage & Navigation Restructuring 🔄
**User Feedback**: Current homepage is not user-friendly for new users. "Get Started" redirects to dashboard instead of being inviting. Need to make homepage content-focused like Dribbble.

**Analysis**: 
- Current homepage shows hero section with carousel but doesn't showcase actual content
- Navigation is cluttered with too many options in dropdown
- Need to differentiate between public content discovery and authenticated user experience
- Should follow Dribbble's pattern: homepage = content feed for everyone

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Homepage Restructure**: Make homepage a public content feed (similar to current discover page)
2. **Navigation Simplification**: Move key nav items to main bar, reduce dropdown clutter
3. **User Experience Flow**: Clear distinction between public browsing and authenticated features
4. **Content Discovery**: Prioritize content over marketing copy for new users

### Detailed Implementation Plan

#### **Phase 1: Homepage Redesign**
**Current State**: Marketing-focused homepage with hero section and carousel
**Target State**: Content-focused homepage showing actual projects

**Tasks**:
1. **Remove Marketing Elements**:
   - Remove hero section with "Showcase Your Design Work" text
   - Remove auto-scrolling carousel with sample projects
   - Remove features section at bottom
   - Keep only essential branding (logo, tagline)

2. **Implement Public Content Feed**:
   - Reuse existing discover feed component for homepage
   - Show all public projects (no authentication required)
   - Add search bar prominently at top
   - Include category/tag filtering
   - Add infinite scroll or pagination

3. **Add Call-to-Action for Non-Authenticated Users**:
   - "Get Started" button in header (leads to signup)
   - "Sign in" button for existing users
   - Subtle prompts to create account for full features

#### **Phase 2: Navigation Restructure**
**Current State**: Complex dropdown with many options
**Target State**: Clean main navigation + simplified dropdown

**New Navigation Structure**:
```
Logo | Search Bar | Discover | Feed* | Profile* | Create* | User Avatar
                                                      [Settings, Logout]
* = Authenticated users only
```

**Tasks**:
1. **Main Navigation Bar**:
   - Logo (left)
   - Search bar (center)
   - Discover (always visible)
   - Feed (authenticated only)
   - Profile (authenticated only)
   - Create button (authenticated only)
   - User avatar dropdown (authenticated only)

2. **User Dropdown Simplification**:
   - Remove redundant navigation items
   - Keep only: Settings, Logout
   - Add user info display

3. **Mobile Navigation**:
   - Hamburger menu for mobile
   - Include all main nav items
   - Maintain responsive design

#### **Phase 3: Page Flow Optimization**
**New User Journey**:
1. **Homepage**: Public content discovery → See value immediately
2. **Sign Up**: Clear path to join platform
3. **Feed**: Personalized content from followed users
4. **Discover**: Browse all content with filters
5. **Profile**: Manage own content and settings

**Authentication Flow**:
- "Get Started" → Signup page
- After signup → Feed page (not dashboard)
- After login → Feed page (not dashboard)
- Dashboard becomes admin/analytics only

#### **Phase 4: Technical Implementation**
**Files to Modify**:
1. `src/app/page.tsx` - Complete homepage redesign
2. `src/components/layout/header.tsx` - Navigation restructure
3. `src/app/feed/page.tsx` - Ensure proper authentication
4. `src/app/discover/page.tsx` - Public access, no auth required
5. `src/middleware.ts` - Update authentication redirects
6. Environment variables - Update Clerk redirect URLs

**API Considerations**:
- Homepage feed API should work without authentication
- Feed API requires authentication
- Discover API should work without authentication
- Profile APIs require authentication

**Success Criteria**:
- Homepage loads and displays content without authentication

- **Discover Page**: Show follow status for project creators
- **Search Results**: Show follow status for user results
- **Project Cards**: Show creator follow status
- **Notifications**: Follow events (future implementation)

## Technical Risks
- **IPFS Costs**: Could spiral if pinning strategy isn't carefully managed
- **Gas Fees**: Base fees could increase, affecting user adoption
- **Storage Scaling**: S3 costs will grow linearly with user uploads
- **Performance**: Image-heavy feeds may impact load times

## Business Risks
- **Market Timing**: Portfolio platforms are competitive space
- **User Education**: Web3 features may confuse traditional designers
- **Retention**: Social features must drive engagement beyond initial upload

# Lessons Learned (To be updated as development progresses)

## Architecture Lessons
- Hybrid Web2/Web3 approach provides best of both worlds
- Progressive enhancement allows gradual feature adoption
- Separation of concerns between core platform and blockchain features

## Development Lessons
- Start with solid Web2 foundation before adding Web3 complexity
- User experience should never be compromised for technical features
- Cost modeling is critical for sustainable Web3 integrations

## Build & Deployment Lessons (Critical for Production)
- **Next.js 15 Breaking Changes**: Params and searchParams are now Promises and must be awaited
  - All dynamic routes need `params: Promise<{ paramName: string }>` type
  - All page components must be `async` and use `await params`
  - Search pages need `searchParams: Promise<{ q?: string }>` type
  - API routes need `params: Promise<{ paramName: string }>` type
  - Always test builds locally before pushing to production

- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Vercel treats warnings as errors in production builds
  - Use `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` for unavoidable any types
  - Fix unused variables by commenting them out or removing them
  - Handle error types properly: `catch (error: any)` with ESLint disable
  - Always run `npm run build` locally before deployment

- **Prisma Query Issues**: Include related data properly in queries
  - When accessing `project.slides`, ensure slides are included in the query
  - Use proper type casting for complex Prisma results
  - Handle nullable fields appropriately in type definitions

- **Component Import Dependencies**: Missing imports cause build failures
  - Always import skeleton components that are referenced in JSX
  - Remove unused imports to avoid linting warnings
  - Check for missing imports when components are not defined errors occur

- **Error Handling Patterns**: Consistent error handling across API routes
  - Use `catch (error: any)` with ESLint disable for Prisma errors
  - Handle specific error codes like 'P2002' (unique constraint) and 'P2025' (not found)
  - Always provide meaningful error messages in API responses

## Business Lessons
- Freemium model works well for creative platforms
- Storage costs must be carefully managed and passed to users appropriately
- Multiple revenue streams provide more stability than single subscription model
