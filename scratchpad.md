# Design Portfolio Platform - Development Scratchpad

# Background and Motivation

The goal is to create a Web2-first design portfolio platform that functions similar to Dribbble, with optional Web3 features for true ownership and permanence. After Dribbble's shutdown that deleted many designers' portfolios, there's a clear market need for a platform where designers truly own their work. The platform will start as a traditional social media-style portfolio site but offer optional blockchain integration for users who want permanent ownership and IPFS storage.

## Development Constraints & Strategy
- **Solo Developer**: Focus on maintainable, well-documented code with minimal external dependencies
- **Low Budget MVP**: Prioritize free tiers and cost-effective services, defer expensive features
- **Flexible Timeline**: Quality over speed, iterate based on user feedback
- **Risk Tolerant**: Willing to experiment with Web3 features but Web2-first approach
- **Low Stakes**: Can afford to pivot or fail fast, focus on learning and validation

# Key Challenges and Analysis
- Balance between Web2 accessibility and Web3 ownership benefits
- Cost management - IPFS pinning and blockchain operations can be expensive at scale
- User onboarding - need to serve both crypto-native and traditional designers
- Storage strategy - hybrid approach with traditional cloud + optional IPFS
- Monetization without alienating free users
- Performance with image-heavy content and social features
- Smart contract security for NFT minting and marketplace features

# Technical Decisions Log

## Database Schema Decisions
- **Decision**: Use Supabase (PostgreSQL) with UUID primary keys
- **Rationale**: Free tier available, built-in auth, real-time features, easier solo development
- **Impact**: Faster development, lower initial costs, built-in features reduce complexity

## Storage Strategy
- **Decision**: Supabase Storage (free tier) + optional web3.storage for Web3
- **Rationale**: Free tier covers MVP needs, web3.storage has generous free allowance
- **Impact**: Near-zero storage costs for MVP, gradual cost scaling with usage

## Subscription Tiers
- **Decision**: 2-tier system (Free: 3 slides, Pro: 10 slides)
- **Rationale**: Simpler to implement, lower barrier to entry, easier to validate
- **Impact**: Faster MVP development, can expand tiers based on user feedback

## Web3 Integration Approach
- **Decision**: Minimal Web3 integration for MVP (basic NFT minting only)
- **Rationale**: Reduces complexity, focuses on core value proposition first
- **Impact**: Faster time to market, lower development risk, can expand based on user demand

# Cost Optimization Strategy

## Free Tier Services (MVP)
- **Database**: Supabase (50MB, 2 projects, 50,000 monthly active users)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (1GB free)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (100GB bandwidth, 100 serverless function executions)
- **Web3 Storage**: web3.storage (5GB free)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (free with database)
- **CDN**: Vercel Edge Network (included with hosting)

## Paid Services (Only When Needed)
- **Stripe**: Only when users upgrade to Pro ($0.30 + 2.9% per transaction)
- **Supabase Pro**: $25/month (when free tier limits exceeded)
- **Vercel Pro**: $20/month (when free tier limits exceeded)

## Cost Monitoring
- Set up alerts for when approaching free tier limits
- Monitor storage usage monthly
- Track bandwidth consumption
- Plan upgrade triggers based on user growth

- Dashboard page for authenticated users
- Header with Clerk UserButton and SignInButton
- Basic navigation structure in place

**Navigation Issues Identified:**
- Discover and search tabs may not be optimal UX
- Need clear path to user profile page
- Search functionality should be more accessible
- Default authenticated user experience needs improvement

**Proposed Navigation Structure:**
1. **Header Navigation:**
   - Logo (links to homepage)
   - Permanent search bar (always visible)
   - User menu (profile, settings, logout)
   - Upload button (for creating new projects)

2. **Page Flow for Authenticated Users:**

   - **Profile Page**: Accessible via user menu or direct URL
   - **Discover Page**: Browse all projects, trending content
   - **Search**: Always available via header search bar
   - **Upload Flow**: Dedicated project creation interface

3. **Page Flow for Unauthenticated Users:**
   - **Homepage**: Landing with hero, features, pricing
   - **Discover Page**: Browse public projects (limited view)
   - **Search**: Available but with limited results
   - **Sign Up/Login**: Clear CTAs throughout

**Success Criteria for Navigation:**
- Users can easily find their profile and projects
- Search is always accessible and prominent
- Clear path from discovery to project creation
- Intuitive flow from signup to first project upload
- Mobile-responsive navigation that works on all devices

- **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase real-time subscriptions

### UI Components Needed
1. **Follow Button Component**
   - Shows "Follow" or "Following" based on current state
   - Handles follow/unfollow actions with optimistic updates
   - Shows loading state during API calls
   - Accessible with proper ARIA labels

2. **Follower/Following Modal**
   - Displays list of followers or following users
   - Shows user avatars, names, and follow status
   - Allows quick follow/unfollow actions
   - Paginated for performance with large lists

3. **Follow Count Display**

   - Appears on profile pages and empty feeds

### API Routes Required
1. **POST /api/follows** - Follow a user
2. **DELETE /api/follows/[userId]** - Unfollow a user
3. **GET /api/follows/followers/[userId]** - Get user's followers
4. **GET /api/follows/following/[userId]** - Get user's following
5. **GET /api/follows/suggestions** - Get follow suggestions

### Integration Points
- **Profile Pages**: Follow button, counts, and lists
- **Activity Feed**: Only show projects from followed users
- **Discover Page**: Show follow status for project creators
- **Search Results**: Show follow status for user results
- **Project Cards**: Show creator follow status
- **Notifications**: Follow events (future implementation)

## Technical Risks
- **IPFS Costs**: Could spiral if pinning strategy isn't carefully managed
- **Gas Fees**: Base fees could increase, affecting user adoption
- **Storage Scaling**: S3 costs will grow linearly with user uploads
- **Performance**: Image-heavy feeds may impact load times

## Business Risks
- **Market Timing**: Portfolio platforms are competitive space
- **User Education**: Web3 features may confuse traditional designers
- **Retention**: Social features must drive engagement beyond initial upload

# Lessons Learned (To be updated as development progresses)

## Architecture Lessons
- Hybrid Web2/Web3 approach provides best of both worlds
- Progressive enhancement allows gradual feature adoption
- Separation of concerns between core platform and blockchain features

## Development Lessons
- Start with solid Web2 foundation before adding Web3 complexity
- User experience should never be compromised for technical features
- Cost modeling is critical for sustainable Web3 integrations

## Business Lessons
